# Does where you go to school matter?

## Summary: 
The purpose of this project is to analyze district-wide standardized test results, aggregate data, and showcase obvious trends in school performance. The data is in the form of 2 separate CSVs that can be found in my resourceâ€™s directory. I used Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to read in the CSVs and merge them so that I had a complete dataset in the form of a data frame that I will use for the analysis. 

## Observations: 

After analyzing the school district I have concluded that where you go to school truly does matter when it comes to standardize test results. Charter schools outperformed district schools with 90% of students passing while only 53% passed in district schools, so you are more likely to pass if you went to a charter school. Not only does the type of school you go to matter, but also the size of the school that you attend. Schools that had less than 2,000 students had 90% of its students pass. What I found most surprising is that schools with a higher per student budget, did not necessarily perform better. The schools that performed better had the lowest per student budget. So, in conclusion, if you wanted a higher chance of performing well on the standardized tests then I would attend a charter school that had less than 2,000 students. 

**District Summary:** Overall the district did not do too well with only 65% of the students passing the math and reading test.

**Top 5 Performing Schools:** (By % Overall Passing): Below you can see the top 5 performing schools and it is interesting to note that all the schools are charter schools. We can also note that the number of total students is quite low compared to the district schools which makes sense as charter school typically have less students.

**Bottom 5 Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing):** Below you can see the bottom 5 performing schools and it is also interesting to note that all the schools are district schools. We can also note the number of total students is rather high.

**Scores by School Spending and Size:** Below you can find scores grouped by the spending and the size of the schools. What we find is that having more money to spend per student does not necessarily lead to higher test scores. The schools with less than $585 per student performed the highest amongst those that had a higher per student budget. When it comes to the school size, it seems that anything above 2000 students can drastically reduce your test scores.

**Scores by School Type:** Below you can find the scores by school type. There is a major difference in overall % passing of charter schools and district schools.
